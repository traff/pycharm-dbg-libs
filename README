gevent monkey-patches some important modules(socket, thread, time, select, threading) which are used by PyCharm debugger. That library contatins copies of this modules.

If installed to Python, PyCharm debugger will use this modules, so gevent monkey-patching won't break things.

Currently tested:
  - Python 2.7.1, Mac OS X 10.7

Needs to be tested for Python 3!!!
